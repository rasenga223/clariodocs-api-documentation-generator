API Doc Generation Interface
Goal: Create a user-friendly, AI-powered interface where users can upload an API file (OpenAPI or Postman), process it, and see the generated documentation preview.

🟢 Phase 1: Upload UI & UX
 Design file upload section (drag & drop + file picker)

 Add supported file types (.json, .yaml, .yml, .postman_collection)

 Show upload progress indicator (if needed)

 Validate file on client-side before submitting

 Trigger API call to backend/upload service on submit

 Handle file upload errors (invalid format, size, etc.)

🟡 Phase 2: AI Processing Status View
 Display a “Processing your docs with AI…” screen or modal

 Add loading animation or progress indicator

 Poll backend for AI completion status (optional)

 Redirect or update UI when generation is done

 Handle processing failures gracefully

🔵 Phase 3: Generated Documentation Preview UI
 Create layout similar to Mintlify (sidebar + main content)

 Populate sidebar with endpoint list grouped by tags/sections

 Render AI-generated content: endpoint summary, parameters, responses, example requests

 Add “Copy” buttons for endpoint paths and code snippets

 Add light/dark mode toggle

 Make it responsive and mobile-friendly

🟣 Phase 4: User Interaction Features
 Add “Regenerate with AI” button

 Add “Edit Manually” (open text editor/modal to tweak content)

 Save changes to Supabase (optional if backend ready)

 Add “Download Markdown” or “Export Docs” option (if planned)

⚪ Optional Enhancements (Post-MVP or Stretch Goals)
 Multi-file upload support

 Auto-detect file type and show file type badge

 Inline comments on endpoints (team collaboration)

 Animate sidebar transitions

 Previews with different themes/branding
