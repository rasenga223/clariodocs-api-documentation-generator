## 2. Objectives & Goals

### **Product Objectives**

- **Simplify Documentation Generation:** Automate the transformation of raw API specifications (Postman/OpenAPI) into polished, developer-friendly documentation.
- **Leverage AI:** Use an AI engine to enhance readability, generate useful endpoint summaries, code examples, and proper documentation structure.
- **Flexible Hosting:** Allow users to choose between hosting on our platform’s subdomain or integrating a custom domain.
- **Rapid MVP Delivery:** Build a fully functional MVP within the hackathon timeframe that showcases AI integration and dynamic documentation generation.

### **Success Criteria**

- **User Onboarding:** Seamless sign-up/login and initial API spec upload with clear instructions.
- **AI-Enhanced Generation:** Successfully parse the API specification and return enriched documentation content.
- **Domain Configuration:** Users can view their docs on a platform subdomain or link a custom domain with clear steps.
- **Responsive UI/UX:** A clean, minimal yet professional interface across devices.
- **Stability:** Error handling for file uploads, domain issues, and AI call failures; smooth end-to-end flow.

## 3. Target Audience

- **Developers** who want a quick way to create, host, and share API documentation without manually writing markdown or configuring static sites.
- **API Providers** looking for a tool that automatically generates comprehensive documentation enriched by AI.
- **Tech Startups/SMBs** that need professional, quickly deployable documentation to reduce support queries and accelerate developer onboarding.

## 4. User Flows

### **A. Onboarding Flow**

1. **User Registration & Verification**
    - **Steps:**
        - User registers via Supabase Auth (email or OAuth).
        - (Optional) Email or SMS verification.
        - Redirect to the onboarding dashboard.
2. **Dashboard Introduction**
    - **Steps:**
        - A guided tour introduces key features: file upload, documentation management, and domain configuration.
        - Display existing projects (if any) and options to begin new ones.
3. **Upload API Spec**
    - **Steps:**
        - User lands on an upload screen featuring a drag-and-drop area with clear instructions.
        - User uploads a Postman Collection or OpenAPI (JSON/YAML) file.
        - Visual progress indicators and error messages in case of malformed files.
4. **Processing & AI Enhancement**
    - **Steps:**
        - Backend parses the file and normalizes API endpoints using tools like `swagger-parser`.
        - An AI service is triggered to generate enriched content: endpoint summaries, usage examples, suggestions for layout, and code snippets.
        - Notify the user when the process is complete (via dashboard notification or email).
5. **Domain Setup & Hosting Configuration**
    - **Steps:**
        - Offer the user a choice: platform-hosted subdomain (e.g., `username.ourdomain.com`) or a custom domain.
        - Provide clear UI with instructions for custom domain configuration (DNS setup via CNAME records and HTTPS configuration).

### **B. Usage Flow**

1. **Initiate Documentation Generation**
    - **Steps:**
        - After file upload, the user clicks “Generate Documentation.”
        - The backend executes the pipeline: parsing → AI enrichment → final document creation.
        - Provide real-time progress updates.
2. **View & Interact with Generated Documentation**
    - **Steps:**
        - Render a dynamic documentation page with a navigation sidebar, endpoint details, and integrated code examples.
        - Allow filtering/searching through endpoints.
3. **Post-Generation Enhancements**
    - **Steps:**
        - On the dashboard, users can view and edit project details.
        - Option to re-trigger AI enrichment for individual endpoints if needed.
4. **Sharing & Management**
    - **Steps:**
        - Shareable URL is provided.
        - Options to update documentation settings, manage domains, and view usage analytics.
